# Algorithms
Through this project, I hope to leverage python's visualization libraries to simplify and explain some of the widely used algorithms found in Computer Science literature. 


# How to set up and run the jupyter notebooks?
<ol>
  <li> Create a Python virtual environment. (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) </li>
  <li> Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` </li>
  <li> Install all the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. (Make sure you are INSIDE your virtual environment) </li>
  <li> Run `pip install ipykernel` </li>
  <li> Run `python -m ipykernel install --name=venv` </li>
  <li> Run `pip install jupyterlab`. At this point, you should have all the necessary libraries required to run `JupyterLab` on your virtual environment. Now, enter `jupyter lab` and that should open up a fresh JupyterLab session on your web browser. </li>
</ol>
