# Algorithms
Through this project, I hope to leverage python's visualization libraries to simplify and explain some of the widely used algorithms found in Computer Science literature. 


# How to set up and run the jupyter notebooks?
1. Create a Python virtual environment.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Run `pip install ipykernel`
4. Run `python -m ipykernel install --name=venv`
5. Run `pip install jupyterlab`
At this point, you should have all the necessary libraries required to run `JupyterLab` on your virtual environment. Now, enter `jupyter lab` and that should open up a fresh JupyterLab session on your web browser.
